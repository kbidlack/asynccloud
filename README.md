# AsyncCloud
An async wrapper for [soundcloud.py](https://github.com/7x11x13/soundcloud.py). I speedran this in around two hours, so it's pretty messy.
I could not be bothered to test this for other versions, but I think it works on Python 3.13. Otherwise, I have no idea.
Also, most of the code is not mine.

## Installation:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/kbidlack/asynccloud.git
```
